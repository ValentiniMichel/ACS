Advance Control System 


Project of Valentini Michel VR472456 about Advance Control System's course 2022/2023.


To run each Assingment, first need to compile 'main_3DoF_robots.m' that initialize the two class 'myRobot.m' and 'Links.m' required for assignments. 
Then is possible to run any assignment that you can find inside the assignment folder.
